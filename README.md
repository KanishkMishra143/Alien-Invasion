# Alien Invasion

Welcome to Alien Invasion, a classic arcade-style shooter built with Python and Pygame!

Take control of a lone spaceship and defend your planet from waves of descending aliens. It's a battle for survival, and your reflexes are your greatest weapon.

## Features

-   **Classic Arcade Action:** Experience the thrill of a retro-style shooter with modern, smooth gameplay.
-   **Increasing Difficulty:** The game starts easy, but with each level you clear, the aliens get faster and the challenge intensifies. How long can you last?
-   **High Score Tracking:** Compete against yourself and your friends! The game saves the highest score, so you always have a record to beat.
-   **Simple Controls:** Easy to learn, but hard to master.

## How to Play

The controls are simple:

-   **Move Left:** ◀️ (Left Arrow Key)
-   **Move Right:** ▶️ (Right Arrow Key)
-   **Shoot:** 🔼 (Up Arrow Key)
-   **Quit:** `Q` key

Your mission is to shoot down all the aliens in each fleet before they reach the bottom of the screen. If an alien touches your ship, you lose a life. Lose all your lives, and the game is over.

## Installation and a look into the future

To play the game, you'll need to have Python and Pygame installed.

1.  **Install Pygame:**
    ```bash
    py -3.11 -m pip install pygame
    ```
2.  **Run the game:**
    ```bash
    py -3.11 alien_invasion.py
    ```
In the future, the game will be packaged into a standalone executable using **PyInstaller**, so you won't need to have Python or Pygame installed to play.
